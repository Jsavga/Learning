# This is the first code I write to import a function from a module
# It's similar to code from python crash course "Importing an entire Module" in Chapter 8
# and uses code I wrote where the function and function call was all in one file

import first_module

first_module.make_pizza('cheese')
first_module.make_pizza('extra cheese', 'hamgurger', 'sausage', 'peppers')
